Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The primary focus of the course project was DriverPass, a platform developed to tackle the problem of inadequate driver education. Research indicated that over 65% of individuals fail their driving tests at the DMV. This project aimed to improve driver training by offering comprehensive online courses and live instruction.

What did you do particularly well?

This course significantly improved my ability to analyze systems and visually represent abstract concepts. Creating diagrams for classes, activities, sequences, and data flow helped me gain a clearer understanding, and I believe I executed them effectively.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I’d like to improve my UML class diagram, particularly in how I document methods. While capturing accessor methods was straightforward, the interconnected nature of the classes calls for a deeper understanding of how the objects will interact to support user needs. Enhancing the diagram with additional methods that reflect this complexity would make it more effective and comprehensive.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

From the beginning, user needs were central to my approach to system design. I created diagrams that represented realistic user interactions, ensuring that the system would be grounded in practical use. When developing the class diagram, I relied on insights from the sequence and activity diagrams to predict how each class would be used. Without this user-centered perspective, the design risked remaining too abstract to effectively address the real-world problems it aimed to solve.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

One of the most valuable lessons I learned in this course is the importance of an iterative design approach. This method has helped me move away from the pressure of getting every detail right from the start, which often slowed me down. Instead, I now make multiple passes over a project, with each iteration adding more depth and detail. I plan to continue developing and applying this technique in future work.
